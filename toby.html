When Toby was a young boy, his parents knew that he was meant to achieve great things. He was not like other children. For instance, when other kids were playing outside, he was already writing his first words and doing advanced math. At the age of thirteen, he entered M.I.T. and graduated with honors. His thesis was a USB-C recharger that didn't need to be plugged into a power source. He used a piezo-element and some magnets to generate electricity. Pure genius! This mechanism is now used in the eyes of robots to power a small camera.
<br/><br/>
At the age of eighteen, he started his first company, named Toby Electronics. He established an assembly line for his product and started selling them in electronic stores. After a few years of hard work, he quickly became a millionaire. He took some time off and met a beautiful girl named Charlotte. Of course, they fell in love and got married. In the first years of their marriage, they visited Paris, Rome, Spain, Amsterdam, and many other cities in Europe. Then they settled down and rented the largest hotel room in Manhattan. They were happy! But eventually, the happiness came to an end. Charlotte filed for divorce and left Toby behind. Luckily, they had no children. Toby started drinking and ended up in rehab. Toby's parents talked to the doctors and proposed taking him back home. Every four weeks, Toby had to go to rehab to take an alcohol test and some medication. His father drove him to the clinic, and during the ride, they talked about life.
<br/><br/>
One day, his father started the conversation with the world's biggest problem: the air pollution from cars. This gave Toby the idea to work on a solution. Toby started to work on an engine that had no exhaust and could replace the current engine in all those cars. Building an electric car was too easy for him, and what were they going to do with all the other cars? So his solution made sense to him. He used parts of robotics and hydrogen fuel cells to make his engine work. His father was proud of his son. Quickly, Toby became a billionaire. He was glad to provide this clean energy solution for the world that he loved so much. But he still did not find happiness. He wanted a son because, after all, he was already forty years old.
<br/><br/>
So the next day, he went to the adoption office and filled in the paperwork. After two months of waiting, he received his letter, and he adopted a young boy from the foster home. His name was Vincent. Toby spoiled him with gifts and visited Disneyland to make him happy. Vincent was a straight-A student at school, and Toby taught him all his knowledge in robotics. However, Vincent wanted to do something different in his life. He wanted to travel around and make music. So Vincent started a band called Radio-Fun. The electronic songs were about robotics, A.I., and society. Toby went to every concert and was proud of his son.
<br/><br/>
Eventually, Toby got old and died. Vincent blamed himself for not spending much time with his father and gave away his father's fortune to all the foster homes in America. The end.
